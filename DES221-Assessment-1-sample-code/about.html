	<p>Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, is an English pirate who operates around the West Indies and the eastern coast of North America. In his early life, he was a sailor on privateer ships before he settled on the Bahamian island of New Providence, a base for Captain Benjamin Hornigold, whose crew Teach joined. Hornigold placed him in command of a sloop that he had captured, and the two engaged in numerous acts of piracy. Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships, one of which was commanded by Stede Bonnet; but Hornigold retired from piracy, taking two vessels with him.</p>

	<p>Teach captured a French slave ship known as La Concorde, renamed her Queen Anne's Revenge, equipped her with 40 guns, and crewed her with over 300 men. He is now a renowned pirate, his nickname derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance; he is reported to tie lit fuses (slow matches) under his hat to frighten his enemies. He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, ransoming the port's inhabitants. He then ran Queen Anne's Revenge aground on a sandbar near Beaufort, North Carolina. He parted company with Bonnet and settled in Bath, North Carolina, also known as Bath Town, where he accepted a royal pardon. But he was soon back at sea, where he attracted the attention of Alexander Spotswood, the Governor of Virginia. Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to try to capture the pirate.</p>

	<p>Teach is a shrewd and calculating leader who spurns the use of violence, relying instead on his fearsome image to elicit the response that he desired from those whom he robs.</p>
