  <h1>About Me</h1>

      <div class="about-left">
        <p>Welcome to Lelani Parker Designs. I am a User Experience Designer who is passionate about designing and developing innovative solutions. With a focus on designing meaningful solutions that benefit all users, businesses and their stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Originally from South Africa, I lived and worked in Ireland prior to immigrating to Australia. I have worked in a variety of industries and in a range of roles. This has allowed me to connect with people from all over the world and gain a unique perspective on users and various businesses.</p>
        <p>Coming from a full-stack development background, I became interested in human-centred design as I wanted to help users solve their problems. My role as a UX Designer allows me to pursue my passion and I enjoy the variety that my role brings me. A typical day can include anything from user research, information architecture and user testing, right through to interface and interaction design,  sometimes even developing a website or app. Although my main goal is to always advocate for the user, I want to ensure that the needs of the business and their stakeholders are met as well. Some of my previous projects can be viewed on my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.</p>
